Passing extra segmentation parameters as Map<String, Object> but take care 
to use only expected type in parameters. Define keys as constants in interested classes.
- Add user interface parameters.
- Write documentation. 

Write automatic test with real data. It can measure performance and accuracy 
in real-life uses. Problem: Need to obtain SRX and text.

Maybe expand TextIterator interface by adding next(Writer) method. It can save
memory. Implementation can read next fragments in loop instead of doing this 
just once.
